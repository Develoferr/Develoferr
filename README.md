-     Hi, I’m Fernando Magdaleno Delgado, this repository contains some projects I have developed for mobile devices.
 
-   I started programming at the end of 2018, studying Bash Shell, GitHub and C programming at Escuela 42 Madrid. At the beginning of 2019 I started developing Android mobile applications with Kotlin.
 
-   I’m currently developing an interesting private Android Kotlin project, with authentication through Firebase, remote database with Firebase, MVVM, ViewBinding, LiveData, Retrofit, Coroutines, Material Design and dependency injection. It will be published soon.

-   I’m currently studying current concepts and external libraries for Android (Hilt, Retrofit, OkHttp ...), in addition to learning the latest technologies (jetpack compose, github copilot)

- I´m also developing a modern C++ game with a team, using unreal engine 5, trying to include all its latest features.
